## About our other products
If you would like to try our paid software, check out our site [here](https://sapphire.ac) or our discord [here](https://discord.sapphire.ac).

All of our free software is developed with the community in mind to either supply free alternatives or a way to introduce new developers to a useful code environment. With that being said, we have to sustain ourselves so the free products we release are very limited so checking out our paid software is much appreciated.

## Compiling
Due to licensing issues, GunaUI could not be directly released in this repo. You'll need to obtain & import GunaUI to compile or remove the ui elements using GunaUI.
